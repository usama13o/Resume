    I was part of a student-lead start-up that aimed to offer branding and identity creation to clients. During this period I invested my time in web development. I learned about the backend of 
    WordPress and how to manages everything with PHP. From there I was able to customize its themes to the client's needs by modifying the source code and adding my own code to meet the requirements.
    • Learned about requirement gathering in client meetings
    • Improved communication skills by liaising with the design team about the feasibility of their designs
    • Utilized my programming skills to tackle the challenges of responsive website implementation
