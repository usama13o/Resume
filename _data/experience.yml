    Developed deep learning model capable of diagnosing chest radio-graphs

  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    Designed a Deep Learning model capable of diagnosing Chest Radio-graphs to potentially help in aiding early
    recognition of pneumothoraces that are usually diagnosed by a radiologist on a Chest X-ray and can sometimes
    be very difficult to confirm.
    • Analyzed data-sets to be tested by looking at previous multi-classification multi-label papers
    • Researched recent model architectures to design, implement , and test performance on the data-sets
    • Implemented a series of models to compare their performance using different performance techniques
