  description: |
    During my degree at Nottingham University I learnt lots of key skills such as team work and project management. During the degree, I have been
    given the chance to explore the fundamental concepts of machine learning and
    data science, and I have developed a keen interest in more specialized areas
    including big data, data mining and the internet of things. 


    Outside academia, I've developed effective communication, collaborative and
    organizational skills through work experience as part of the Activities network
    in the Student Union at my university. In this role, I was part of a team responsible for handling various events on campus, this included providing designs and posters for the events, and coordinating between societies and other teams for the execution of the events. I've also volunteered as a Student Ambassador for the Computer Science school, which saw me encourage potential students to pursue a degree in Computer/Data Science through sharing my own experiences and setting-up coding workshops. I've held other positions too, including as a
    member of the Organization team of the first TEDx event on-campus, and as a member of the Elections committee in the university where I managed the implementation of a new voting system in the university. I've been extremely proactive throughout my degree, from being a 
    member of a squash team to fundraising for charities such as Islamic Relief and orphanage Foundations.
