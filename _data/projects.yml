    A pipeline implementation is explored that tries to enhance the accuracy of Deep Learning models in the detection and segmentation of pneumothorax from a set of chest radiographs.
  description: |
    By cascading a CNN and a U-Net, we ensure that the CNN will filter out all the cases with no pathology, i.e.’Normal’ cases, leaving the U-Net (trained on positive cases only) to focus on arranging a set of filters for the separation of pathology from the infected lungs. The models are cross validated on the same data to ensure consistency. The proposed method demonstrates higher accuracy in both segmenting and detecting the pathology. By implementing it with more complex architectures and integrating in the domain knowledge of radiologists, this methods can be applied in conjunction with other applications to rapidly triage and prioritise cases for the presence of anomalies.

    The API for this site has been build using <mark>Symfony</mark> while the front end is a <mark>React</mark>/<mark>Redux</mark> app.
    I have used <mark>Docker</mark> to set up a development environment and <mark>Heroku</mark> to deploy and host the site. I have
    a suite of unit and API tests for the backend and unit tests for the front end.

    I have been using this project as a way to increase many of my skills and also learn new things. I have particually
    enjoyed managing my own project and designing my own architecture and implementing this to a high standard.

    Feel free to check out the whole project on GitHub to get a feel for how I work [here](https://github.com/sproogen/itsgoingto.be).

#     Forecastr is an android app designed to make it easy to view the forecast at your favourite spots. Targeted at
#     sports where the weather is key to a good session forecastr makes it quick to see which spot is best all
#     on one screen. Forecastr includes wind, weather, swell and tide times.

#     Forecastr is an app I have been building as I have a keen interest in
#     <mark>Android</mark> development and wanted a personal project I could use to help build my skills. I chose to build
#     this app as I felt like it's something I would use myself and also something that would set some good challenges
#     across lots of different areas of the build.

#     During the build I have utilised a number of different android libraries such as ActionBarSherlock, Dagger and
#     Otto. As well as these the app also talks to a backend API and uses a SQLite DB.
